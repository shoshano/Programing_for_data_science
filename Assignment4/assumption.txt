Data set:
- with classes so probably we need supervised learning 
- EDA
- preprocesing 
- model choosing 
- statistical test?
- AUC ROC value for all tested models 


Recipe for selecting a model and estimating its
performance using a hold-out set
1 Divide the dataset into a training and test set -- done
2 Further divide the training set into a proper training set and
validation set1
3 Use the various data preparation techniques, learning
algorithms and hyper-parameters to generate models from the
proper training set
4 Find the best performing configuration w.r.t. the validation
set
5 Measure the performance of the model trained using this
configuration and the full training set on the test set
6 Generate a new model from the full dataset using the same
configuration2


1. Preprocesing:
    a. delete missing data
    b. freatures extraction RDKit
    c. one-hot + normalizatin + missing values
    d. SMOTH algorithm
2. Second eda 
3. Model building  
4. Model selecting
5. Paramiter selection +  cross validation
5. Model chcecking + results + discution
